        <b>WHILE 2021 WAS</b> largely defined by its proximity to the start of
        the <b>Covid-19 pandemic</b>, when worldwide lockdowns and cinema
        closings forced moviegoers to establish new viewing habits, 2022 seemed
        to be about getting back to “business as usual.” Which, itself, is a
        constantly evolving concept. But the past 12 months have provided all
        the benchmarks people have come to expect from any single year of
        moviedom: massive blockbusters <mark>(hello, Maverick)</mark>,
        surprising flops (sorry, Lightyear), unexpected hits
        <mark>(Sonic the Hedgehog 2?!)</mark>, and a parade of superheroes. It
        all added up to a really solid year of entertainment, with fantastic
        films being made in countless genres (horror is at a real high point)
        and coming from virtually every corner of the world. Below are WIRED’s
        picks for the best movies of 2022.

            prisoner in the gloomy jailhouse of Shawshank after being found
            guilty of a crime he did not commit. The film portrays the man's
            unique way of dealing with his new, torturous life; along the way he
            befriends a number of fellow prisoners, most notably a wise
            long-term inmate named Red.</strong

            >The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia
            family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding.
            Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also
            present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a
            part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to
            all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do
            not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs
            and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it.
            What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new
            ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant
            in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families
            which could tear the Corleone family apart.</strong

            >Set within a year after the events of Batman Begins (2005), Batman,
            Lieutenant James Gordon, and new District Attorney Harvey Dent
            successfully begin to round up the criminals that plague Gotham
            City, until a mysterious and sadistic criminal mastermind known only
            as "The Joker" appears in Gotham, creating a new wave of chaos.
            Batman's struggle against The Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing
            him to "confront everything he believes" and improve his technology
            to stop him. A love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent, and
            Rachel Dawes.</strong
